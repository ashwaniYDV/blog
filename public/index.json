I’m a final year undergrad at IIT Patna, who believe in technology and playing around with stuff. I hail from Kanpur (UP), India. After years of slogging and hardwork, I finally managed to gain admission to the Indian Institute of Technology, Patna as an undergraduate in Electrical Engineering. I am passionate about computer science, building things and celebrating the joy of programming. I tend to waste my time reading books, watching movies, TV-series, playing games, hanging out with friends, sleeping and prcrstintng (…). Apart from programming my other hobbies also include playing football and guitar. I am a huge fan of sci-fi and fantasy genre novels. Why did you decide to create a blog site? I create the site based on the principle of: to share my knowledge and to share my hobbies. I felt that I needed to expose all of my raw accumulative knowledge in something or somewhere. Making some search on the internet I discover that, to retain 75% learners need to put into practice what they learned and incredible 90% learners approximately retain when they teach someone else/use immediately. In general, to left my footprint on this virtual world, and to bore you all. One more thing You noticed that I’m not an “English native” not even an “Expert”, but I’m writing in English because I want to get better and reach to the fluency. I’ll appreciate if you help me spend your precious time send me your suggestion and correction about my sentences. ;) ","date":"0001-01-01","objectID":"/blog/about/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"","uri":"/blog/about/"}]
