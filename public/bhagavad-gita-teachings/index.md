# Bhagavad Gita Teachings


### https://gitagpt.org/

The Bhagavad Gita is a sacred Hindu text that contains the conversation between the Pandava prince Arjuna and his guide Krishna on a number of important topics. Among these topics are the nature of the soul, the purpose of life, and the path to liberation from suffering. The Gita teaches that the soul is eternal and perfect, and that our purpose in life is to realize our true nature. To reach this goal, we must practice detachment from the things of this world and focus our attention on God.
